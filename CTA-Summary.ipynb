    "# Analyzing CTA Rider Data\n",

    "As part of a recent job interview, I was asked to analyze [data on daily ridership values](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f) for Chicago's subway system, the L. I also used some [data on station locations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-System-Information-List-of-L-Stops/8pix-ypme), which was also taken from Chicago's very cool open data portal. For the interview, I was asked to answer two 'warm-up' questions, and then was asked to brainstorm ways in which this data could be used to help a business decide where to open a new location. \n",

    "Finally, I'm going to explore some ideas for how this data can be used to help a business decide where to open a new location. The first question I wanted to address with this data set was where ridership has changed the most over time. For businesses like restaurants or bars, customers are often unwilling to travel long distances, so it might prove valuable to be near popular L stops. One way to do this would be to look at total ridership, but I suspect that real estate prices near the most popular stops (largely in the Loop) are very high and may not provide the best return on investment. By looking instead at the relative change in ridership over a fixed time interval, the areas that have shown the largest growth in recent years can be identified. \n",
    "\n",
    "I started by looking at the change over a five year period from 2011 to 2015, but a further analysis on the timeseries data might suggest a more informative period. (As an aside, I also looked at the change over the entire dataset from 2001-2016, some stations have seen increases as high as 250%!) Here, I apply some pandas logic to calculate the total ridership in 2011 and 2016 and then calculate the relative change."

The areas showing the highest relative rate of weekend use are mostly along the red and purple lines, which I suspect may be connected to the fact that both of Chicagoâ€™s baseball stadiums are on the red line, but I would need to do more analysis to investigate that.
